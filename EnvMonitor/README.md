## Enviroment monitor
Measure temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and CO2 concentration using [Atom Lite](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/atom_lite). The measurements are pushed to [Ambient](https://ambidata.io/) IoT server. The data can be visualized and seen in the web app.

## Preparation

Prepare below devices and connect them to Atom Lite.

- [ENV III sensor](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/unit/envIII) for temperature, humidity, and pressure measurement.
- [TVOC/eCO2](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/unit/tvoc) for CO2 measurement.
- [HUB](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/unit/hub) to expand single port into three ports.
